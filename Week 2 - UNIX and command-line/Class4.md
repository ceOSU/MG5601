# Activity 1
Log into OSC (ondemand.osc.edu)
Go to your personal scratch directory
`/fs/scratch/PAS2698/yourdir/`
Make a new directory here called 'unixmore' (mkdir)
Remember, the general structure of unix commands is: program flags input output. In this case, program is "mkdir" and output is "unixmore", which can be run as follows:
`mkdir unixmore`
Change directory to 'unixmore' (cd)
In this directory, we will get a file with yeast (S. cerevisiae) genome features. Originally, these files are available from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; yeastgenome.org) but we will get the files that are hosted by biostar handbook (allegedly, links to files and datasets in SGD can change frequently).
